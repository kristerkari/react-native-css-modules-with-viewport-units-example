This is an example app that shows how you can use CSS Viewport Units in React Native.

This app should work the same way as [vw/vh Middle Div](https://codepen.io/falkus/pen/LkmLJR) codepen by [Martin Falkus](https://codepen.io/falkus/). You can try to run in first in the browser and then see how it works in React Native.
